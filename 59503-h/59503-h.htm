<p class="caption1">HOME MANUFACTURE AND USE OF UNFERMENTED
GRAPE JUICE.</p>



<hr class="r20" />

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>Unfermented grape juice has no doubt been used ever since wine
has been made from the grape. The following practical suggestions
will enable housewives to put up unfermented juice at the time of the
fruit harvest, and thus to utilize much fruit that is now annually lost
through inability to preserve it in the fresh state. In this form it is
a pleasant, wholesome drink and food well adapted to home use. On
some farms enough such preventable wastes occur almost every year
to largely reduce the possible profits, or even to cause failure to meet
the running expenses of the farm. By preventing these wastes an
unprofitable farm may often be made profitable.</p>



<h2><a name="HISTORICAL_NOTES" id="HISTORICAL_NOTES">HISTORICAL NOTES.</a></h2>


<p>Galenius, the Greek physician and writer says (A. D. 131): "A good
many Asiatic wines were stored in bottles which were hung in the
corner of fireplaces, where, by evaporation, they became dry." This
process was called "fumarium."</p>

<p>The Greeks had two kinds of wine, "protoplon," or first juice of
the grape before pressing, and "denterion," or pressed juice. The
Romans called them "vinum primarium" and "vinum secondarium."
Some of them drank the juice before fermentation had started, and
called it "mustum." After the must or juice had been through a
heating process (called "reduction" nowadays), they called it "frutum,"
and when, after long heating, it had been reduced to one-half
or one-third its original volume, they called it "sapa." This was used
by the Romans on their bread and was equivalent to what we now call
grape syrup.</p>

<p>In Europe physicians often send their patients to the wine-growing
districts during vintage time to take daily rations of the fresh juice as
it comes from the crusher. This, however, restricts its use to a brief
season of the year and to the immediate vicinity of the vineyards, or
to individuals who are yet strong enough to undertake the journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span></p>

<p>Of late years repeated efforts have been made to prevent the juice
from fermenting and to preserve it in vessels of such size and shape
as can be easily transported, thus rendering its use possible at all
times of the year. Until recently its use has been almost exclusively
restricted to juice for medicinal or sacramental purposes. Unrestricted
and general use has been retarded through lack of knowledge of the
principles underlying the process of manufacture. This lack of knowledge
and of the necessary skill in applying it has resulted in many
failures, thus rendering the production of a good article uncertain and
expensive.</p>



<h2><a name="COMPOSITION_OF_THE_GRAPE" id="COMPOSITION_OF_THE_GRAPE">COMPOSITION OF THE GRAPE.</a></h2>


<p>The grape contains 12 to 28 per cent of sugar, about 2 to 3 per cent
of nitrogenous substances, and some tartaric and malic acids. The
skins contain tannin, cream of tartar, and coloring matter. The seeds
contain tannin, starchy matters, and fat. The stems contain tannin,
diverse acids, and mucilaginous matter. The value of the juice made
from any grape is determined by the relative proportion and composition
of these various parts.</p>


<h2><a name="CAUSES_OF_FERMENTATION" id="CAUSES_OF_FERMENTATION">CAUSES OF FERMENTATION.</a></h2>


<p>It is well known that grapes and other fruits when ripe have the
invisible spores of various fungi, yeasts (ferments), and bacteria
adhering to their skins and stems. When dry these spores are inert,
but after the grapes are crushed and the spores are immersed in the
juice they become active and begin to multiply. If the juice is warm,
the changes take place rapidly; if, on the other hand, it is cool, the
change is slower. But in either case, if left alone, the organisms
increase until the juice ferments. The most favorable temperature
for fermentation is between 65&deg; F. and 88&deg; F. Cold checks, but does
not kill, the ferment. This fermentation, now commonly called the
elliptic yeast, changes the sugar in the grape to alcohol and carbonic-acid
gas, and is the leading factor in converting must<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> into wine.
Hence it will be readily seen that to keep grape juice sweet fermentation
must be prevented, and to be salable the product must be clear,
bright, and attractive.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The word "must" as used in wine making invariably refers to the unfermented
juice of the grape and is so used in this publication.</p>
</div>




<h2><a name="METHODS_OF_PREVENTING_FERMENTATION" id="METHODS_OF_PREVENTING_FERMENTATION">METHODS OF PREVENTING FERMENTATION.</a></h2>


<p>Fermentation may be prevented in either of two ways:</p>

<p>(1) By chemical methods, which consist in the addition of germ
poisons or antiseptics, which either kill the germs or prevent their
growth. Of these the principal ones used are salicylic, sulphurous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
boracic, and benzoic acids, formalin, fluorides, and saccharin. As
these substances are generally regarded as adulterants and injurious,
their use is not recommended.</p>

<p>(2) Mechanical means are sometimes employed. The germs are
either removed by some mechanical means, such as filtering or a centrifugal
apparatus, or they are destroyed by heat, electricity, etc. Of
these, heat has so far been found the most practical.</p>

<p>When a liquid is heated to a sufficiently high temperature all organisms
in it are killed. The degree of heat required, however, differs
not only with the particular kind of organism, but also with the liquid
in which they are held. Time is also a factor. An organism may not
be killed if heated to a high temperature and quickly cooled. If,
however, the temperature is kept at the same high degree for some
time, it will be killed. It must also be borne in mind that fungi,
including yeasts, exist in the growing and the resting states, the latter
being much more resistant than the former. A characteristic of the
fungi and their spores is their great resistance to heat when dry. In
this state they can be heated to 212&deg; F. without being killed. The
spores of the common mold are even more resistant. This should be
well considered in sterilizing bottles and corks, which should be
steamed to 240&deg; F. for at least fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Practical tests so far made indicate that grape juice can be safely
sterilized at from 165&deg; F. to 176&deg; F. At this temperature the flavor
is hardly changed, while at a temperature much above 200&deg; F. it is.
This is an important point, as the flavor and quality of the product
depend on it.</p>

<p>This bulletin being intended for the farmer or the housewife only,
the writer refers such readers as desire to go into the manufacture of
grape juice in a systematic manner for commercial purposes to Bulletin
24, Bureau of Plant Industry, Department of Agriculture, on
the same subject, this publication treating only of methods that can
be applied in every home.</p>


<h2><a name="HOME_MANUFACTURE" id="HOME_MANUFACTURE">HOME MANUFACTURE.</a></h2>


<p>Use only clean, sound, well-ripened but not over-ripe grapes. If
an ordinary cider mill is at hand, it may be used for crushing and
pressing, or the grapes may be crushed and pressed with the hands.
If a light-colored juice is desired, put the crushed grapes in a cleanly
washed cloth sack and tie up. Then either hang up securely and twist
it or let two persons take hold, one on each end of the sack (<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1, p. 8</a>),
and twist until the greater part of the juice is expressed. Then gradually
heat the juice in a double boiler or a large stone jar in a pan of
hot water, so that the juice does not come in direct contact with the
fire, at a temperature of 180&deg; F. to 200&deg; F.; never above 200&deg; F. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
is best to use a thermometer, but if there be none at hand heat the
juice until it steams, but do not allow it to boil. Put it in a glass or
enameled vessel to settle for
twenty-four hours; carefully
drain the juice from the sediment,
and run it through
several thicknesses of clean
flannel, or a conic filter made
from woolen cloth or felt
may be used. This filter is
fixed to a hoop of iron, which can be suspended wherever necessary
(<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>). After this fill into clean bottles. Do not fill entirely, but
leave room for the liquid to expand when again
heated. Fit a thin board over the bottom of an
ordinary wash boiler (<a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>), set the filled bottles
(ordinary glass fruit jars are just as good) in it, fill
in with water around the bottles to within about an
inch of the tops, and gradually heat until it is about
to simmer. Then take the bottles out and cork or
seal immediately. It is a good idea to take the further
precaution of sealing the corks over with
sealing wax or paraffin to prevent mold germs from
entering through the corks. Should it be desired
to make a red juice, heat the crushed grapes to not
above 200&deg; F., strain through a clean cloth or drip
bag, as shown in <a href="#fig_4">fig. 4</a> (no pressure should be used),
set away to cool and settle, and proceed the same as
with light-colored juice. Many people do not even
go to the trouble of letting the juice settle after straining it, but
reheat and seal it up immediately, simply setting the vessels away in
a cool place in an upright position where they will be undisturbed.
The juice is thus allowed to settle, and when wanted for use the clear
juice is simply taken off the sediment. Any person familiar with the
process of canning fruit can also preserve grape juice, for the principles
involved are identical.</p>

<p>One of the leading defects so far found in unfermented juice is that
much of it is not clear, a condition which very much detracts from its
otherwise attractive appearance and due to two causes
already alluded to. Either the final sterilization in
bottles has been at a higher temperature than the preceding
one, or the juice has not been properly filtered
or has not been filtered at all. In other cases the
juice has been sterilized at such a high temperature
that it has a disagreeable scorched taste. It should
be remembered that attempts to sterilize at a temperature
above 195&deg; F. are dangerous, so far as the
flavor of the finished product is concerned.</p>

<p>Another serious mistake is sometimes made by putting
the juice into bottles so large that much of it becomes
spoiled before it is used after the bottles are
opened. Unfermented grape juice properly made and bottled will keep
indefinitely, if it is not exposed to the atmosphere or mold germs; but
when a bottle is once opened it should, like canned goods, be used as
soon as possible, to keep it from
spoiling.</p>


<h2><a name="MANUFACTURE_OF_LARGER_QUANTITIES" id="MANUFACTURE_OF_LARGER_QUANTITIES">MANUFACTURE OF LARGER QUANTITIES.</a></h2>


<p>Another method of making
unfermented grape juice, which
is often resorted to where a sufficiently
large quantity is made
atone time, consists in this:</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 228px;">
<a id="fig_5" name="fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/fig_5.png" width="228" height="225" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Barrel and skid.</div>
</div>

<p>Take a clean keg or barrel
(one that has previously been
made sweet). Lay this upon a
skid consisting of two scantlings
or pieces of timber of perhaps
20 feet long, in such a manner as
to make a runway (<a href="#fig_5">fig. 5</a>). Then take a sulphur match, made by dipping
strips of clean muslin about 1 inch wide and 10 inches long into
melted brimstone, cool it and attach it to a piece of wire fastened in the
lower end of a bung and bent over at the end, so as to form a hook (<a href="#fig_6">fig.
6</a>). Light the match and by means of the wire suspend it in the barrel,
bung the barrel up tight, and allow it to burn as long as it will. Repeat
this until fresh sulphur matches will no longer burn in the barrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span></p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 51px;">
<a id="fig_6" name="fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/fig_6.png" width="51" height="184" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Sulphur hook.</div>
</div>

<p>Then take enough fresh grape juice to fill the barrel one-third full,
bung up tight, and roll and agitate violently on the skid for a few
minutes. Then burn more sulphur matches in it until no more will
burn, fill in more juice until the barrel is about two-thirds
full; agitate and roll again. Repeat the burning
process as before, after which fill the barrel completely
with grape juice and roll. The barrel should then be
bunged tightly and stored in a cool place with the bung
up, and so secured that the
package can not be shaken.
In the course of a few weeks
the juice will have become
clear and can then be racked
of' and filled into bottles or
jars direct, sterilized, and
corked or sealed up ready
for use. By this method,
however, unless skillfully
handled, the juice is apt to have a slight
taste of the sulphur.</p>


<h2><a id="USEFUL_APPLIANCES" name="USEFUL_APPLIANCES"></a>A FEW USEFUL APPLIANCES.</h2>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 216px;">
<a id="fig_7" name="fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/fig_7.png" width="216" height="477" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Corking machine.</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a> shows a very practical and inexpensive
corking machine. The illustration
shows the cork in place, ready to be
driven through the tapering hole
in the machine into the neck of
the bottle underneath. The corks
should be put in hot water and
allowed to stand for a few minutes
before using in order to
soften and make them pliable.
This enables one to use a cork
large enough to seal securely.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to set the
bottles on a flat piece of rubber
or on a piece of cloth folded several
times, as shown in the figure,
so as to take the jar of the
blow when the cork is driven.
It is even a wise precaution to
have a pan underneath, as it frequently occurs that bottles thought to
be entirely good have blemishes and break.</p>

<p>An ordinary cider press is not expensive; nevertheless the majority
of farms do not have one, and it frequently occurs that a farm is located
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span>
so far away from any establishment dealing in such implements that
the fruit might spoil or not be sufficiently valuable to justify the
purchase price and time lost and expense incurred in getting it.
<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a> gives an illustration of a lever press, very efficient for this
and similar uses, which any farmer handy with tools can make, the
material for which can be found on almost any farm at any time.
The press consists of the following parts:</p>

<p>Two upright posts (F) set deep and firmly in the ground side by side
and about 12 inches apart. (It is a good idea to attach some deadmen to
them in the ground to prevent them pulling out too easily.) Between
these posts the lever (E) is hung by means of a bolt (T), or the lever may
be hung to the side of a building, or a hole notched into a tree large
enough to admit the end of the lever and a bolt run through that. At
the other end of the lever are two posts, so set that the lever can be
raised up between them by means of block and tackle. The press itself
consists of two timbers (D), on which the press bottom (B) rests, and
on this bottom is the press basket, consisting of the two sides and two
ends, and so constructed that it can be easily taken apart and set up
again, being held together at the ends by means of rods (L). The sides
and ends should be bored full of small holes from three-eighths to one-half
inch in diameter to allow exit for the juice.</p>

P, Upright posts. G, Block and tackle. T, Lever bolt. I, Press block.</div>
</div>

<p>After the press is filled, the top (which is made to fit in the inside of
the basket) and cross blocks (1) are put on and the lever is then allowed
to press down on it. A press like this has the advantage that it can be
filled in the evening and left to press until morning while the farmer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
sleeps. The precaution, of course, must be taken to set a tub (C) large
enough to hold the juice under the press.</p>

<p>It is perhaps well to state that the longer and heavier the lever the
greater the pressure it exerts. Where it is not convenient to make
the lever very long, weights are placed or hung on the outer extremity
of the lever to increase the pressure. It will thus be seen that with
a little ingenuity a person can adapt the press to suit his individual
requirements.</p>

<p>For ordinary purposes a press basket 3 feet square and 2 feet high
will be found a very convenient size. This will accommodate a ton of
crushed grapes.</p>

<p>This table is interesting in so far that California unfermented grape
juices are made from Viniferas or foreign varieties, whereas the Concord
is a Labruska or one of our American sorts. The difference in
taste and smell is even more pronounced than the analysis would
indicate.</p>


<h2><a name="FLAVOR_AND_QUALITY_IN_GRAPE_JUICE" id="FLAVOR_AND_QUALITY_IN_GRAPE_JUICE">FLAVOR AND QUALITY IN GRAPE JUICE.</a></h2>


<p>In the making of unfermented grape juice a great deal of judgment
can be displayed and many variations produced so as to suit almost
any taste by the careful selection of the varieties of grapes from
which it is made. From the Mission grape, for instance, when fully
ripe, a juice would be obtained that would be delicate and simply
sweet, without any other taste; from the Muscat we would get that
rich musky flavor found in our leading raisins; in the Concord that
sprightly foxy taste so well known; in the Catawba or Isabella
that fragrance so peculiarly their own, and in the Iona a pleasing,
mild, yet just pronounced enough aroma and taste to strike the right
spot. Thus we might continue along the list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span></p>

<p>Equally as pronounced variations in color can be had, as, for instance,
almost colorless, yellow, orange, light red, red, and a deep purple.</p>

<p>The writer has often been asked what kind of grapes should be
used in making unfermented grape juice, when, as a matter of fact, it
can be made from any grape; not only this, but unfermented juice is
made from other fruits as well, for instance, apples, pears, cherries&mdash;and
berries of different kinds yield excellent juices. It is really good
judgment in selecting the right varieties when planting for fruit production.
That also determines the quality of our unfermented juice.
For instance, the richer, sweeter, and better in quality the fruit we use,
the richer, sweeter, and better will be our unfermented juice. If, on
the other hand, the fruit is sour, green, and insipid, the juice will be
likewise. As stated before, the intention of this bulletin is to show
how to avoid some wastes, and to increase income by utilizing those
products of which there is a surplus, and instead of, as is usually done,
letting them rot, convert them into something that can be kept, used,
and disposed of at any time when desired, or when fresh fruit is not
available.</p>


<h2><a name="USES_OF_UNFERMENTED_GRAPE_JUICE" id="USES_OF_UNFERMENTED_GRAPE_JUICE">USES OF UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE.</a></h2>


<p>The uses are indeed many. It is used in sickness, convalescence,
and good health; as a preventive, restorative, and cure; by the young,
by persons in the prime of life, and by those in old age. It is used in
churches for sacramental purposes; at soda fountains as a cool and
refreshing drink; in homes, at hotels, and at restaurants as a food, as a
beverage, as a dessert, and in many other ways. When people become
accustomed to it they rarely give it up. When properly prepared,
unfermented grape juice can be made to please the eye by its color
and attractive appearance, the sense of smell by its aroma or fragrance,
the palate by its pleasant flavor.</p>

<p>It is food and drink, refreshment and nourishment, all in one. Not
a by product, but made from fruit going to waste&mdash;one of the blessings
given us, that some are too careless, others too ignorant, to make
use of.</p>


<h2><a name="FOOD_VALUE_OF_UNFERMENTED_GRAPE_JUICE" id="FOOD_VALUE_OF_UNFERMENTED_GRAPE_JUICE">FOOD VALUE OF UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE.</a></h2>


<p>The effects of unfermented grape juice on the human system have
been studied for a number of years, especially at the so-called grape
cures so long in vogue in Europe. A smaller number of investigations
have been made in laboratories.</p>

<p>It is quite generally claimed that using a reasonably large amount of
unfermented grape juice with an otherwise suitable mixed diet is beneficial
and that digestion is improved, intestinal fermentation diminished,
and that gains in body weight result. It should not be forgotten
that the abundant diet and hygienic methods of living practiced at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span>
grape cures play an important part, but even taking all this into
account it seems fair to conclude that some of the good results can be
directly attributed to the unfermented grape juice.</p>

<p>Grape juice contains the same kinds of nutrients as other foods. The
percentage of water is high, and thus it resembles liquid foods more
closely than solid foods. It is sometimes compared with milk, the most
common liquid food. It contains less water than milk, more carbohydrates,
and less protein, fat, and ash. Carbohydrates, largely present
in the form of sugar, are the principal nutritive ingredients. It is
evident, therefore, that grape juice is essentially an energy yielding
food, and may help the body to become fatter, though it can not materially
assist in building nitrogenous tissue. Sugars in moderate
amounts are wholesome foods, and grape juice offers such material
in a reasonably dilute as well as palatable form. Undoubtedly the
agreeable flavor increases the appetite, a by no means unimportant
consideration.</p>


<h2><a name="A_FEW_GOOD_RECIPES" id="A_FEW_GOOD_RECIPES">A FEW GOOD RECIPES.</a></h2>


<p class="caption3">GRAPE NECTAR.</p>

<p>Take the juice of 2 lemons and 1 orange, 1 pint of grape juice, 1
